# World Layoffs in MySQL and Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global layoff trends using MySQL for data cleaning and analysis and Power BI for visualizations.
The goal is to identify which countries and industries were most impacted by layoffs and to present those insights in an interactive dashboard.
The raw dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com

The final Power BI dashboard includes KPIs and charts that are easy to understand at a glance.

## ❓ Business Questions Answered

The dashboard and SQL queries were designed to answer the following key questions:

* What FIVE countries had the most layoffs overall?

* Which industries had the highest average layoff percentage?

* Which industries have the highest layoff severity?

## 🧠 Definitions

* Total Layoffs: The total number of companies or employees affected by layoffs.

* Average Layoff : The average amount of a company’s workforce laid off within an industry.

* Layoff Severity: How extreme layoffs were within all industries, measured using high averages.
